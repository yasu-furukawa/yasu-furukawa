I am looking for highly motivated
and hard-working graduate students to work with in my group with an
ambition to explorer research to change the world. Please apply from <a href="http://cse.wustl.edu/graduateprograms/Pages/default.aspx">our
department's application website</a>, then mention my name in the
application.
<!-- Unfortunately, our group does not have a spot this year (2014-2015). -->

<h2>For current Ph.D students or researchers looking for a postdoc
position:<br>
</h2>
<strike>
I am also looking for a postdoc with strong research background in 3D
vision, which usually means multiple first-author papers at premier
Computer Vision conferences (CVPR, ICCV and ECCV).</strike>
<hr>
<h2>For Wash-U undergraduates:</h2>
I am looking for outstanding undergraduate students who are interested
in my research. If you would like to know what kinds of research are
conducted in my lab, please look at our publications, images, and
videos, which should give you a good idea. In general, you should be
very good at C++ (Java experience is a good start) with strong math
skills to be a good researcher/engineer in 3D Computer Vision. If you
are
interested, the following is a list of entry projects that should be
relatively approachable without Computer Vision knowledge. Currently,
there is only one project, but I will add more in the future. Projects
have many degrees of freedom and please write code to do something
interesting/fun/useful, then drop me an email. We will discuss your
results and further opportunities. Of course, if you have already
worked on a Computer Vision project from your interests, you can bring
that in to start discussion.<br>

      <h3>#1. Analyzing CAD (Computer Aided Design) models<br>
      </h3>
      <br>
Dealing with 3D models and images is a frequent and essential operation
in 3D Vision. Take a look at a CAD model, which people created by a CAD
software and shared on the web. Write some code to analyze the model
file (simple text format), then visualize analyzed information via 3D
model files. <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse">Google
3D Warehouse</a> is a repository of CAD models, and this is <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=48b79b17de9a35123077e35720b0bc29&amp;prevstart=0">a
link to a CAD model of Colloseum in Rome</a>, which we are often
interested in. The model may not be downloadable in a friendly text
format, and I already converted the model to a friendly text format
.obj with the texture images, which can be found <a href="col.tgz">here</a>. This
is <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=2d1c3d338f8662df87ff49486a939c6f&amp;prevstart=0">a
link to another Colloseum model in 3D warehouse</a> and <a href="col2.tgz">the
corresponding OBJ file package</a>.<br>
      <br>
OBJ
format is a text format for 3D graphics and very simple. More details
about the format can be found <a href="http://www.eg-models.de/formats/Format_Obj.html">here</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file">here</a> or <a href="http://www.martinreddy.net/gfx/3d/OBJ.spec">here</a>, for
example.<br>
      <br>
The CAD model in the sketchup format can be opened by <a href="http://www.sketchup.com">the sketchup
software</a> (free). Other miscellaneous 3D model formats can be opened
by <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">Meshlab</a> for
visualization.<br>
      <br>
The following is an example of what can be done on this 3D data more
specifically.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Each face of a 3D model is associated with a texture image,
whose name is specified in a line somewhere before. Architectural
scenes exhibit repetition and you may be able to identify repeating
structure by collecting all the faces that are associated with the same
texture image. Generate a new OBJ file that only contains such facaes
to prove that you could extract a single structure that contains many
repetitions. You may be able to also identify the core repeating
element, then how many times it is repeated. Repeating structures may
not use exactly the same texture image, but often their texture images
have very similar filenames, which can be used to identify the entire
repeating structure. Generate a file and open
it by Meshlab to verify.<br>
        </li>
        <li>A CAD model may consist of multiple groups, which a modeler
probably generated for organization. You can probably find such group
names inside a OBJ file. Write a code to extract 3D geometry, whose
group name is X, starts from Y, and etc. Again, generate a new OBJ file
and open it by Meshlab to verify.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
